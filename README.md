This package can be used to send HTTP requests using Curl extension.

There are two classes: one for sending regular HTTP requests and another to send multiple parallel requests.

Both classes can send HTTP requests directly or via proxy, securely using SSL or not, setting the referrer URL, cookies, custom headers, etc...

Every Curl extension option can be set with a class variable assignment.

It can also manage the cookie values that are sent each Web server by creating, updating and deleting cookie values which are shared by different objects of the class.
